- Split terminal block -- (5 pins for encoder on one terminal block, 3
  pins for +5v, gnd, and shield on another)
    - add screen print to the board to identify what goes where, maybe
      a graphic with a bracket around the encoder stuff if it's all on
      one terminal block
- Do we want a jumper on the board to optionally tie shield and ground
  together?
